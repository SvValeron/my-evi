    "Gabe Newell`s  early fascination with computers led him to explore programming as a young teen. By the age of 13, he was already writing simple programs that demonstrated his innate curiosity for how technology worked. <br><br>After enrolling at Harvard University, Newell quickly realized that academic theories could not replace real-world experience. Eager to immerse himself in the rapidly evolving tech world, he made the bold decision to leave Harvard and join Microsoft. Over the course of 13 years at Microsoft, he played a role in developing the early versions of the Windows operating system, gaining invaluable insights into large-scale software projects. <br><br>In 1996, Newell teamed up with his colleague Mike Harrington to co-found Valve. Their ambition was to redefine video gaming by emphasizing innovative design and immersive storytelling. The release of Half-Life in 1998 not only showcased their creative vision but also set new standards for narrative-driven gameplay in the industry. <br><br>Newell spearheaded the launch of Steam in 2003—a digital distribution platform that revolutionized how games were bought, updated, and experienced. By integrating community features and streamlining software updates, Steam created a dynamic ecosystem that transformed the relationship between developers and gamers. <br><br>Beyond his contributions to gaming, Newell’s career reflects a multifaceted approach to innovation and personal development. He overcame a challenging eye condition, Fuchs’ dystrophy, through advanced surgical treatments, ensuring that his vision—and his work—remained uncompromised. Moreover, his creative pursuits extend to hands-on hobbies such as metalwork and vintage tool collecting, and he has even co-founded ventures in neural interface technology and marine research.
